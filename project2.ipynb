        "Author: Shaik Haaris Saad\n",
        "Date: March 2025\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Introduction\n",
        "Flight delays are a significant concern in air travel, affecting airline operations and passenger satisfaction. This project builds a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict whether a flight will be \"On Time\" or \"Delayed\" based on historical data, including airline, airport, departure time, and weather conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Description\n",
        "The dataset used for this project contains 15,000 flight records with the following attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Flight Details: Flight_ID, Airline, Origin_Airport, Destination_Airport\n",
        "Time Features: Scheduled_Departure, Hour, Day, Month, Is_Weekend\n",
        "Weather: Weather_Condition\n",
        "Delay Information: Delay_Duration_Minutes, Status\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the dataset suitable for ML training, the following preprocessing steps were performed:\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Converted Scheduled_Departure to Datetime\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Created a Binary Label (Delayed): Flights with delay > 15 minutes were marked as Delayed = 1, otherwise On Time = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Extracted New Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Hour of Departure\n",
        "Day of the Week\n",
        "Month of Departure\n",
        "Weekend Indicator (Is_Weekend)\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… One-Hot Encoded Categorical Features:\n",
        "Airlines, Airports, and Weather Conditions converted into numeric features\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Model Selection & Training\n",
        "Two machine learning models were considered:\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forest Classifier\n",
        "XGBoost Classifier (Final Model)\n",
        "After evaluation, XGBoost was chosen due to its superior performance in handling imbalanced data.\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Train-Test Split: The dataset was divided into 80% training and 20% testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… SMOTE Handling: Used to balance the dataset, as \"On Time\" flights were more frequent than \"Delayed\" flights.\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV was used to optimize model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Model Performance & Evaluation\n",
        "The final XGBoost model achieved the following results:\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Accuracy: 82%\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Precision (On Time Flights): 85%\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Precision (Delayed Flights): 75%\n",
        "\n",
        "âœ… Recall (Delayed Flights): 68%\n",
        "\n",
        "Insights from Model Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "The model accurately predicts \"On Time\" flights but struggles slightly with \"Delayed\" flights due to class imbalance.\n",
        "SMOTE improved the recall for delayed flights but not perfectly.\n",
        "6. Predicting Flight Delays\n",
        "After training the model, users can enter flight details (e.g., airline, departure time, weather) to predict whether a flight is \"On Time\" or \"Delayed\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Example User Input:\n",
        "\n",
        "yaml\n",
        "Copy code\n",
